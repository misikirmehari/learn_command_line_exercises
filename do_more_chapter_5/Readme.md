## Do More

### cd to the joe directory with one command.

   `cd temp/stuff/things/frank/joe/`

### cd back to temp with one command, but not further above that.

   `cd ../../../..`

### Find out how to cd to your "home directory" with one command.

   `cd ~`

### cd to your Documents directory, then find it with your GUI file browser (Finder, Windows Explorer, etc.).

   `cd Documents/` | `using CLI`
   `Finder/Documents/` | `using Finder`
 
### cd to your Downloads directory, then find it with your file browser.

   `cd Downloads/` | `using CLI `
   `Finder/ Downloads/`| `using Finder`

### Find another directory with your file browser, then cd to it.
   `cd ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2016/homework/` |`using CLI`
   `Finder/davinci_coders_t2_2016/homework` |`using Finder`
 

### Remember when you put quotes around a directory with spaces in it? You can do that with any command. For example, if you have a directory I Have Fun, then you can do: cd "I Have Fun"
   `cd "test folder"`

# Chapter 6: List Directory (ls)

## Do More

### On Unix, try the ls -lR command while you're in temp.
  `ls -lr ` : list directories with permissions, links , owner, group , size , time and name


### Use cd to get to other directories on your computer then use ls to see what's in them.

   `ls -A`
   `ls -a`
   `ls -d`

### Update your notebook with new questions. I know you probably have some, because I'm not covering everything about this command.

### Remember that if you get lost, then use ls and pwd to figure out where you are, then go to where you need to be with cd.

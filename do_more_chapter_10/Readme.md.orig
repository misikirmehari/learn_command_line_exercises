### Copy a file to your home directory or desktop.

   `cp -r ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2016/building_the_toolbelt_t2_2016/presentations/ ~/Desktop/`
    
### Find these files in your graphical user interface and open them in a text editor.

   `This files are found on desktop`
    
### Notice how sometimes I put a / (slash) at the end of a directory? That makes sure the file is really a directory, so if the directory doesn't exist I'll get an error.

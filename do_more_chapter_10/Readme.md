# Chapter 10: Copy a file (cp)

## Do More
> ***NOTE***: The answers for this chapter should not include the use of cd (change directory).

### Use the cp -r command to copy more directories with files in them.

   `cp -r ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2016/building_the_toolbelt_t2_2016/presentations/ ~/Desktop/`
   `cp -r ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2016/ ~/Desktop/`

### Copy a file to your home directory or desktop.

   `cp -r ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2016/building_the_toolbelt_t2_2016/presentations/ ~/Desktop/`
    
### Find these files in your graphical user interface and open them in a text editor.

   `This files are found on desktop`
    
### Notice how sometimes I put a / (slash) at the end of a directory? That makes sure the file is really a directory, so if the directory doesn't exist I'll get an error.

    Please use markdown formatting listing the command(s) you ran to accomplish this

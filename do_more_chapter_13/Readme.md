# Chapter 13: Stream a file (cat)

## Do More

### Make a few more text files and work with cat.

   `touch test.txt`
   `vim test.txt`
   `cat test.txt`
   `This is a test file created  for chapter 13`
   `echo "chapter13 testfile" > test1.txt`
   `cat test1.txt`
   `chapter13 testfile`
    
    

### Unix: Try cat ex12.txt ex13.txt and see what it does.

   `cat test.txt test1.txt`
   `This is a test file created  for chapter 13`
   `chapter13 testfile`

   `Using cat for two files displays the content of the file 
   one after the other`

If you're not already, please go into the checkpoint_2 directory.
    
   `pwd`
   `/Users/misikirmehari/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/checkpoint_2`

Remove the foo/bar/baz directory (do not use cd here...)
    
   `rm -rf foo/bar/baz`
        
Create an empty file named file2.txt
        
  `touch file2.txt`
            
Let's copy foo/bar/file1.txt to foo/some_other_file.txt
   
   `cp foo/bar/file1.txt  foo/some_other_file.txt`

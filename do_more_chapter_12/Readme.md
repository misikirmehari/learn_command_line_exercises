# Chapter 12: View a File (less, more)

## Do More

### Open your text file again and repeatedly copy-paste the text so that it's about 50-100 lines long.

    

### Copy it to your temp directory again so you can look at it.

   `cp ex12.txt ~/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/temp/`
    
### Now do the exercise again, but this time page through it. On Unix you use the spacebar and w (the letter w) to go down and up. Arrow keys also work. On Windows just hit spacebar to page through.

   `less ex12.txt`
   `more ex12.txt`
   
### Look at some of the empty files you created too.
   `less haha.txt` : opens an empty window
   `more haha.txt` : Doen't display anything
    
### The cp command will overwrite files that already exist so be careful copying files around.

# Chapter 22: Changing Environment Variables (export)

## Do More

### Take and list out all the environment variables you've found and then go look up what they are online (please do 5-10 or so).
   
   `PATH: set of directories where executable programs are located`
   `LANG : controls the locale of the host`
   `OLDPWD: contains the full path of the previous working directory`
   `PWD: containd the full path of the current working directory`
   `Apple_PubSub_Socket_Render: is the backend for how Safari and Mail handle RSS feeds.`
    
### Read the man page for env again. What else can it do?
    
   ` env command can be used to set environment, execute command, print environment`
